# üåê Node Network

## What is the Node Network?

The Node Network is an initiative by **My First Bitcoin** aimed at **independent** and **decentralizing education**.  

It's a global network of grassroots Bitcoin communities and educational initiatives, each teaching the [Bitcoin Diploma](https://github.com/MyFirstBitcoin/Bitcoin-Diploma-2025) and using educational resources that are created and provided by My First Bitcoin in an open-source manner.

üåü The nodes commit to respect the network‚Äôs **consensus rules**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Consensus Rules:
- Independence with zero external influence.
- Impartiality.
- Community-based approach.
- Bitcoin-only focus.
- Prioritization of empowerment over profits.
- Quality maintenance.

The Node Network consists of **Light Nodes** and **Full Nodes**, both having their own characteristics.

In our [Community Hub](https://network.myfirstbitcoin.io), Light Nodes, Full Nodes, and the entire community come together. Feel free to take a look around and explore!
